# Advent of Code 2017 - My solutions

https://adventofcode.com/2017

These solutions are not the most optimal way of doing things. They are what I could come up with, in my available time and talent. I'm publishing them for others to either learn or build upon them.

Actual solutions are original, but I have tidied and documented them afterwards.

All solutions are in Haskell, except for one which is is in Bash, may God forgive me ;)
